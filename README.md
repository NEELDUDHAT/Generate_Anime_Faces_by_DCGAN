# Generate_Anime_Faces_by_DCGAN
This project uses a DCGAN to generate high-quality anime faces. It consists of a generator that creates images and a discriminator that evaluates them, improving quality over time. Trained on an anime face dataset, DCGAN effectively synthesizes realistic outputs through adversarial learning.
